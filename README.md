## Greetings ðŸ˜Ž

I'm currently an Engineering Manager at [Ibotta](https://ibotta.com/), managing a team of seven engineers that are focused on affiliate integrations and making the [Ibotta App](https://ipn.ibotta.com/) a partner on the [IPN](https://ipn.ibotta.com/).

Before that, I was a Senior Platform Engineer primarily focused in Databricks, AWS, and Node, building out strong backend solutions for an internal data analytics tool.

And before that, I built [Haven](https://haven-secrets.github.io/), a Secrets Manager for Node applications.
